- Feature updates:
 - Output format modified:
  - CSV files are now RFC 4180 compatible by default (comma is the 
  default field separator; CR-LF is used as end of line; variable
  names are enclosed in double quotes as needed).
  - -m switch is itroduced to support mangling of variable names 
  as needed by CSV importers that don't handle quoting.
  - Only variable names are written out in the header line (no
  aliasing information is provided).
  - Numerical values are printed for enum and boolean variables.
  - -n switch only controls the number of output points and works
  orthogonal to the -h switch specifying the time step length.
  - Only variables with causality output are written out by default.
  -f switch ma

   -i <file name> - flag is now used to specify file name with input
   signals for the FMU. Details on the file format are given in
