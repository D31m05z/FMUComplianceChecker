File: BUILD-FMUChecker.txt
Build instructions for FMI Compliance Checker (FMUChecker) application.

FMUChecker build system utilizes CMake (see <http://www.cmake.org/>)
to generate the native build scripts for the application.
It is recommended to use "cmake-gui" on Windows or "ccmake"
to configure the build. 

To build from a terminal command line on Linux or Mac with default settings use:
	mkdir build; cd build
	cmake -DFMUCHK_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir name> <checker dir>
	make install test
To build in MSYS terminal with g++/gcc on Windows:
	mkdir build; cd build
	cmake -DFMUCHK_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir name> -G "MSYS Makefiles" <checker dir>
	make install test
To build from command line with Microsoft Visual Studio 10 compilers on Windows:
	mkdir build; cd build
	cmake -DFMUCHK_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir name> -G "Visual Studio 10" <checker dir>	
	cmake --build . --config MinSizeRel --target install
The generated solution files can be used in the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE as
well.

The primary target of the library build script is a command-line
executable:  <prefix>/bin/fmuChecket.<platform>[.extention]

Note that FMUChecker depends on FMI Library, that needs to be downloaded
separately from <http://www.fmi-standard.org>, or alternatively, from
<http://www.fmi-library.org>. For more information on FMI Library, see
<http://www.fmi-library.org>. The current version of the FMUChecker
depends on FMI Library v2.0a1.

The following FMUChecker specific build configuration options are provided:

FMUCHK_INSTALL_PREFIX - Prefix prepended to install directories. 
	Default: <build_dir>/../install
	
FMUCHK_FMIL_HOME_DIR - Path to the directory with FMIL sources
	downloaded from <http://www.jmodelica.org/FMILibrary>. 
	Default: "No FMIL"
	
FMUCHK_FMI_STANDARD_HEADERS  - Path to the FMI standard headers directory. 
	Leave empty to use the headers from FMIL, which is the default.
	Headers for specific standards versions are expected in subdirectories 
	FMI1, FMI2, etc.
	
FMUCHK_ENABLE_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG - Enable log level 'debug'. If the option 
   is of then the debug level is not compiled in. Default: OFF
   
FMUCHK_TEST_FMUS_DIR - Directory with FMUs to be used in tests (checker 
	will run for each FMU). Output files can be found in <build>/TestOutput/
	Default: ${FMUCHK_HOME}/TestFMUs.
	
FMUCHK_BUILD_WITH_STATIC_RTLIB - Use static run-time libraries (/MT or 
	/MTd linker flags. Default: ON. Only available for Microsoft Visual
	Studio projects.

FMUCHK_FMI_PLATFORM - Defines the subdirectory within FMU where binaries 
	should be searched, e.g., win32. Default: detected automatically
	for win32/64, linux32/64, darwin32/64. Overriding the default
	value normally requires modification to compiler and linker flags
	to get a consistent build. May be used to build 32-bit binary
	on a 64-bit system.
